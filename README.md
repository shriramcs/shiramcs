### Hi ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Shriram Sapparad, I'm a software engineer working on front-end side of web applications development.

Currently working on web applications using React.js, Vue 2/3, and Angular.

I started my Angular journey from 20014 with version 1.27 and was on 9 before I left JPMorgan Chase India Ltd, Bengaluru.

I started my career as web applications developer using ASP.NET for banking systems at Tata Consultancy Services before I move to Societe Generale, where I got my first experience with angular 1.27 and ended up with 3rd prize in the organization level competition.
